//! Spin based synchronization.
//!
//! This module provides implementation for the `SpinMutex` to allow for spin-based thread
//! synchronization. These spinning primitives are meant for use within the kernel, outside of the
//! kernel `Mutex` should be used as it provides a much more efficient use of CPU time.

// NOTE: This is mainly taken from the `spin` crate (https://github.com/mvdnes/spin-rs), we've
// reproduced it here because atomic operations (which are needed for the crate) are not supported
// on our target, and so we've had to implement our own atomic library.

// NOTE: This has been copied into the memory allocation layer because of the way our OS stack is
// laid out. It's a dumb but straigtforward hack and allow us to make heap allocation thread-safe.

/// A spin lock used to synchronize access to a shared resource.
///
/// This locking primitive is based on spinning. If the lock is already held by another thread
/// instead of the running thread yielding the CPU to another thread it will just spin. In a single
/// threaded environment this will just waste time spinning at best, at worst it could deadlock the
/// CPU if no other thread are able to run while this one is spinning. Nevertheless it is a useful
/// tool to have within the kernel as the kernel itself cannot be preempted. In order to provide
/// synchronization across multiple kernel threads a spin lock must be used. If there is only one
/// kernel thread then there will be no contention over the resources and so deadlock will be a
/// non-issue.
