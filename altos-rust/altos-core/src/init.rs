// FIXME: Try to see if there's a better way to handle this for testing
// We do this cfg for testing purposes, this allows doctests to run without any compilation errors.

//! Contains functions used for initialization of the kernel

/// Initialize the heap so memory can be dynamically allocated

/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use altos_core::init::init_heap;
///
/// // An example for the Cortex-M0 processor
///
/// #[cfg(target_arch="arm")]
/// unsafe {
///   let heap_start: usize;
///   let heap_size: usize;
///   asm!(
///     concat!(
///       "ldr r0, =_heap_start\n",
