//! Sleep based synchronization.
//!
//! This module provides implementation for the `Mutex` to allow for sleep-based thread
//! synchronization. When a thread should block on a shared resource, it will be put to sleep and
//! woken up when the resource become free again. This allows for more efficient use of CPU time as
//! a thread that is waiting on a resource cannot do any work.
//!
//! When a thread is woken up, it is not guaranteed that the resource is available. Another thread
//! could have been waiting on the same resource and woken up first. If this is the case, then that
//! other thread could now be holding the lock.
